# Qlue v4.x (development)

Qlue is a lightweight framework for Java web applications. Its purpose is to provide a structure
in which applications can be developed with as little complexity as possible.

I decided to write Qlue probably somewhere around 2007, mostly because all other Java frameworks
for web applications were too complex and difficult to use. I just couldn't get myself to work
with any of them. I wanted something simple, but couldn't find it.

Qlue is stable and has a number of nice features, even some that are pretty difficult to find elsewhere
(e.g., automatic context-sensitive output encoding to prevent XSS). On the other hand, it's not documented
and there are virtually no examples.
