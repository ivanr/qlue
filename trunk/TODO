- Fix TODO and XXX markers
    
- Static file handling

  - Implement proper MIME type resolution
  
  - Implement downloads with support for caching and resumption
  
  - Refuse to download anything from WEB-INF, even if such configuration
    is used by the developer (and via an external request)?   
    
- In debug mode page trailer:

  - Sort model fields by name

- Debugging mode is useless when running behind a proxy because we always
  work with the proxy's IP address. Need a way to extract client IP address
  from X-Forwarded-For.

- When in debug mode, override redirections in order to display in-page
  debugging information.
  
- Reset array parameter to null or empty array when there are no parameters


- Finally (before release candidate):

  - Implement logging consistently throughout the framework
  
  - Have consistent error messages
  
  - Review code comments and documentation
  
  - Review code
  
  - Review access permissions
  
  - Write minimal documentation
