    
- Deliver static files ourselves

  - Add variables to the router (how else are we going to know where the root folder is?)
  
  - Add static: prefix
  
- Move initialization parameters from web.xml into qlue.properties

- In debug mode page trailer:

  - Sort model fields by name
  
- Reset array parameter to null or empty array when there are no parameters

- Debugging mode is useless when running behind a proxy because we always
  work with the proxy's IP address. Need a way to extract client IP address
  from X-Forwarded-For.

- When in debug mode, override redirections in order to display in-page
  debugging information.  
  
- Write minimal documentation
