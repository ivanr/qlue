Qlue 2.0 to-do list
-------------------

- Move the handling of folders without the trailing slash
  from the 404 page handler into the framework
  
- Add a hook so that custom exception handlers can add
  development mode output.

- Support parameter arrays

- Support file parameters

- Support stateful file uploads (where uploaded files are kept
  for the duration of the life of a page)
  
- Verify that it is possible to use command objects

- Property editors should throw exceptions on conversion errors

- Perhaps page parameters can implement some validation interface
  and help Qlue with validation; or perhaps the annotation could
  point to the annotation interface (that may be better because
  it documents input requirements)

- Fix Canoe

- Write better examples

- Review code for security issues

- Write minimal documentation
