- Write minimal documentation

- Have an URL rewrite phase that changes the actual path into something else

- In debug mode:

  - Sort page fields
  
  - Do not display static Page fields
  
- Reset array parameter to null or empty array when there are no parameters

- Debugging mode is useless when running behind a proxy because we always
  work with the proxy's IP address. Need a way to extract client IP address
  from X-Forwarded-For.
