Qlue 2.0 to-do list
-------------------
  
- Support parameter arrays
 
- Verify that it is possible to use command objects

- Property editors should throw exceptions on conversion errors

- Perhaps page parameters can implement some validation interface
  and help Qlue with validation; or perhaps the annotation could
  point to the annotation interface (that may be better because
  it documents input requirements)

- Fix Canoe

- Write better examples

- Review code for security issues

- Generate JavaDoc documentation

- Write minimal documentation
