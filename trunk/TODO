- Routing: Process .vm files directly when page class not available

- Routing: control resource caching from the routing configuration

- On error, dump transaction context into a file; it would also be useful to have all
  the log entries created during/for that transaction
  
- On error, notify admin and include transaction context

- When behind a trusted proxy, use its unique ID (which is transported in a header)

- Routing: URL such as http://www.feistyduck.com/library/modsecurity-handbook
  should always redirect to http://www.feistyduck.com/library/modsecurity-handbook/
  (forward slash at the end). Relative links don't work otherwise.
  
- Routing: Add support for string interpolation on the right-hand side. Use case:
  redirect to a different URL, using some of the regex captures.
  
- Routing: Add support for programmatic route manipulation

- Support resource expiration in the future

- Support session expiration: keep underlying session timeout long, but detect
  inactive sessions and show them a friendly user error message
  
- Debug mode output should display all log messages emitted during the
  processing of the current request.

- Binding: Add support for validation of fixed-value fields (e.g.,
  drop-down boxes). Provide list to Qlue.
 
- Finally (before release candidate):

  - Implement logging consistently throughout the framework
  
  - Have consistent error messages
  
  - Review class and method access permissions
  
  - Review code
   

Misc
----

- Users should be able to create private instances of MimeTypes, they should be able to
  tell the framework to use another mime type, and/or to override the settings
