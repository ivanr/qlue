- Write minimal documentation

- Have an URL rewrite phase that changes the actual path into something else

- In debug mode:

  - Sort page fields
  
  - Do not display static Page fields
  
- Reset array parameter to null or empty array when there are no parameters

- Debugging mode is useless when running behind a proxy because we always
  work with the proxy's IP address. Need a way to extract client IP address
  from X-Forwarded-For.
  
- Add URL parameters to Transaction.

- Make it possible for the effective URL to be change. 
  
- Change PageResolver to Router, and enable it to respond with a View if it
  wants to.
  
- Handle all application requests and serve static resources.   

- When in debug mode, override redirections in order to display in-page
  debugging information.
